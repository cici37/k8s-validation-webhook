# A pod with a conflicting securityContext setting: it has to run as a non-root
# user, but we explicitly request a user id of 0 (root).
# Without the webhook, the pod could be created, but would be unable to launch
# due to an unenforceable security context leading to it being stuck in a
# `CreateContainerConfigError` status. With the webhook, the creation of
# the pod is outright rejected.
